This repository is a git read only copy of the ansible repository
used by the gluster.org project to manage the infrastructure.

How to contribute to the configuration
======================================

If you want to contribute, please open a PR against that
repository and if we do not react, please mail gluster-infra@gluster.org.

The process is still new and being tested, so expect a few roadblocks for the time being.

Other documentation
===================

We keep a set of SOP and related documentation on https://gluster-infra-docs.readthedocs.io/

The git repository for this documentation can be found on https://github.com/gluster/infra-docs
